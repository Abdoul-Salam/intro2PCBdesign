# Introduction to PCB Design
First offered during Winter Quarter AY2018-2019, we're currently updating some material and thinking about offering it again during Spring Quarter AY2019-2020.

There are many excellent online tutorials about how to use the various PCB design programs available. This being the case, in this workshop / course we will focus on :
* rapid prototyping of electronics (copper tape on various substrates, "dead-bug" construction, etc.)
* placing some context around PCB design (how & why we make PCBs, various fabrication technologies, etc.)
* building experience with PCB design workflow (by designing & sending boards out for fabrication every week)
* using ancillary tools to ensure form, fit, and function requirements are met
* providing entry points to the more "advanced" topics associated with PCB design

If this seems interesting to you, please check out the overview & details page.

We are interested in your feedback! Please send comments, question and suggestions to: lab64ca@ee.stanford.edu

Please use the [issues tab](../../issues) to post questions and answer other students' questions.

Thx,
 Steve
