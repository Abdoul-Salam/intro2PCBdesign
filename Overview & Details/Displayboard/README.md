# Display board (Week 7/8)

The main goals for this week are:

### For the Activity -

* Find footprints for components.<br/>

The Activity material may be found [HERE](../Displayboard/Displayboard_Activity).

### For the Content -
* Learn TODO<br/>
* See what it takes to integrate multiple components to make something!

These questions are (hopefully) answered in this week's [*Content*](../Displayboard/Displayboard_Content) section.
