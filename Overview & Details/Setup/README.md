## Week 0 - Why make PCBs & Our Goals

The main goals for this week are:

### For the Activity -
* to install and configure KiCAD
* to confirm this has been done correctly by opening a board design project in KiCAD
* to get an introduction to the KiCAD workflow (Please watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9b_6WLemmg)

The Activity material may be found [HERE](./Setup_Activity/README.md).


### For the Content -
* to understand *why* we might want to make a printed circuit board (PCB)
* to understand *why* we are doing all this work, that is *what* is the goal we are trying to achieve

These questions are (hopefully) answered in this week's *Content* section, [HERE](./Setup_Content/README.md).
