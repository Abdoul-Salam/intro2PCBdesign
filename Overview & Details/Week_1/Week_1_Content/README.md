# Week 1 - PCB Structure and Design Workflow

In this segment we will cover
* the physical structure of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and how they are made, and
* the design workflow that results in the generation of the files needed for PCB fabrication

## PCB Structure
Currently there are three major classes of PCB structure:
* Rigid PCBs,
* Flex PCBs, and
* Metal substrate PCBs

Let's talk about each type in turn...


* __Rigid PCBs__ - These are the traditional multilayer PCBs made by laminating alternating layers of copper and a substrate material.

The substrate is most commonly an epoxy / glass fiber composite called FR4, however there are many different materials that may be used. You may have heard of some of these, such as FR408, Rogers Duroid, etc. Materials are selected based on the trade-off between cost and performance. "Performance" is judged by evaluating the different electrical properties, flame resistance, and so forth.

The number of layers ranges from just one (a single-sided board) to over thirty (30) layers in the case of backplanes, etc. The finished thickness of rigid boards ranges typically from ~ 0.2mm (0.008") to over 9.5 mm (0.375"). Again, thicker boards are usually for backplanes where dense connectivity is required. A **very** common thickness is 1.6 mm (0.063") nominal with a tolerance of ±10%.

Rigid boards often appear green resulting from the use of a green soldermask to protect the outer copper traces from abrasion and corrosion. For those wanting boards with a different appearance, board manufacturers are now offering a variety of soldermask colors including red, white, yellow, blue, purple, black, and matte green.

Here is an image of a very common type of board, and one you will be designing, the four-layer rigid PCB -

It is called a "FOUR LAYER BOARD" because it has four __copper__ layers (all the other stuff doesn't get counted).

  <summary>Just to be sure we're clear about this...</summary>
  
  FOR A "FOUR" LAYER BOARD WE NEED:
  
1. Top Silkscreen ---------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Top Soldermask ---------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Top Copper -------------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Inner Layer #1 ---------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Inner Layer #2 ---------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Bottom Copper ----------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Bottom Soldermask ------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. Bottom Silkscreen ------------------------------------> (Gerber file)
1. NC Drill file for Plated Through Holes (PTH) ---------> (Excellon file)
1. NC Drill file for Non-Plated Through Holes (NPTH) ----> (Excellon file)
1.  FAB Drawing (usually .pdf file) that specifies stackup, dimensions, tolerances, etc.

And *YOU'RE* going to make them all!! YAY!!

To really get a feel for this, it is helpful to see how rigid boards are fabricated.

__*Please let us know if you have any questions!*__

* __Flexible PCBs__ - Also known as *flex* or FPC boards, these are useful whenever things have to be folded up or move during operation.

The FPC substrate is almost always a type of polyimide material. The most common type goes by the tradename Kapton™ which is made by DuPont Chemical. Polyimide has remarkable material properties that make it nearly ideally suited as an FPC substrate. For example, polyimide does not melt, does not sustain a flame, is mechanically strong, has excellent dielectric properties, and so on. One aspect of polyimide that you may need to take into account is that it is an excellent thermal insulator. This means that heat generated by components will need to be carefully managed.

Typical FPC construction ranges from just one copper layer to as many as ten (10) layers. The finished thickness of flex boards ranges typically from ~ 0.08mm (0.003") to over 0.3 mm (0.012") with 0.1mm (~ 0.004") being a common thickness.

Due to material considerations, flex board colors are not so exciting; usually they are yellow, black, or white.

[Here is some interesting information on flex board stack-up](https://www.pcbway.com/pcb_prototype/Stack_up_for_FPC.html).

* __Metal Substrate PCBs__ - These have become very popular for LED lighting applications.

The heat generated by LED operation can be more easily managed using metal substrates. This can be readily understood with a quick look at their construction -
