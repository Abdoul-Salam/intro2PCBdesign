# LED board (Week 9)

The main goals for this week are:

### For the Activity -

* Find footprints for componenets.<br/>

The Activity material may be found [HERE](../LEDboard/LEDboard_Activity).

### For the Content -
* Learn TODO <br/>
* See what it takes to integrate multiple components to make something!

These questions are (hopefully) answered in this week's [*Content*](../LEDboard/LEDboard_Content) section.
