## Week 0

The main goals for this week are:

* to understand *why* we might want to make a printed circuit board (PCB)
* to understand *why* we are doing all this work, that is *what* is the goal we are trying to achieve

These questions are (hopefully) answered in this week's *Content* section.

Some slides illustrating some prototyping techniques and hopefully motivating the first point may be found
in ["Intro to PCB Design 1.pdf"](/Week_0/Week_0_Content/Intro to PCB Design 1.pdf).
