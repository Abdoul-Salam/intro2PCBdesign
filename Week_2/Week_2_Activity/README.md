## Week_2_Activity Summary
This week we are getting ready to layout the Audio Board block. In our weekly activity session Max showed us how to do several things:
1. How to look at the documentation for a part, in this case the Texas Instruments TAS5705 (he actually showed the TI TPA3250, but that part is too powerful for our needs and the TAS5705 has features that will make our UberRadio sound better).
2. How to look through the documentation and find the "eval board" information which gives us a huge head start.
3. How to search for part footprints and install those in the libraries.
4. How to convert a design in Eagle into a KiCAD project by going through the process with the Adafruit VS1053 CODEC Breakout PCB.

We will put more detailed information on each of these steps here as time permits.
