# How to convert an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) in Inkscape into a DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) for Kicad.

<br/>

<br/>

1. Import your SVG file into Inkscape by going to `File -> Import`.

2. Select the image by clicking on it. Then click on `Object -> Ungroup`.

3. Continue to select the image. Then click `Path -> Break Apart`.

4. Export this new, edited file as a DXF by going to `File -> Save As` and saving the file with extension `.dxf`.

#### Remember where you saved the `.dxf` file. Next, continue with the Protoboard Activity! When you are ready to add your board outline make sure to use your fancy new `.dxf` file.
