# ACTIVITY #1 - Build a modern "1/2 sized" proto board

You will learn to and demonstrate that you can:
1. create a board outline
2. place a connector
3. place mounting holes
4. export the board to a CAD program
5. assess fit
6. re-position components to achieve mechanical clearance / fit
7. generate the required fabrication files
8. submit the design for DFM
9. order the board

**EXTRA CREDIT:**
You can make a simple board that has a more complicated outline and have that fabricated instead (maybe a holiday related thing? snowman, snowflake, Xmas tree, ornament, Halloween gizmo, etc.). It MUST still have a USB connector for power but attachment points may be substituted for mounting holes.

## Introduction - 

In the course of building things one may not want to wait for a printed circuit board to be fabricated. Often results can be obtained more quickly by "prototyping" a circuit. This is particularly true if the circuit is simple and only one is required. There are many different small prototyping PCBs available commercially that are suitable for this sort of application. Among these is the so-called "1/2 sized" breadboard. These tend to be about 2 3/8" by 3 1/4" x 1/16" thick. They have an array of holes into which one can place components for soldering. The "back" side of the board is used for point to point wiring. If one so chooses, sockets and wire-wrapping techniques may be employed so that circuitry can be built up in sections and can be re-wired as the need arises.

Although these are super cool, for some projects they can be very difficult to use. For example, if you want to build a USB powered thing, it is difficult to place USB connectors on the board since no provision has been made for that. Also, this size protoboard usually has two centrally located mounting holes; great if you want to work on a tippy gizmo!

**SO**, you are going to fix these deficiencies by creating your OWN "1/2" sized protoboard!!

Let's look at a couple of existing "1/2 sized" protoboards...

What do you notice?

OK, so now what is our approach?

Let's think about this!!

Hmmm... we need a board outline. How will we generate this? How will we get it from one
program into another? Do we need to worry about the position during import?

What about the mounting holes? How will we make those?

Gee, putting all those holes in looks like a real pain. How should we do that?

So far, so good, but what about the USB connector?

OK, great!! I think I've got this!!

Now we do the "board layout". Good job!!

Time to make sure it fits in the box.

Let's check out boxes at (Hammond Manufacturing) [https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/plastic/1591]

Uh, oh! That USB connector needs to move. How do we do that?

OK, Looking good! Let's generate the artwork and send it out for DFM.

Remember to check the artwork!! OH, NO, I need to find a viewer...

It looks pretty good, let's check to see if it passes DFM.

It does!! Yay!!

OK, let's place the order.

Wow! That was super cool! I can't wait to see it and solder things up.
