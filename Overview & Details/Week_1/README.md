# Week 1 - PCB Structure & Design Workflow

## PCB Structure
Currently there are three major classes of PCB structure:

* __Rigid PCBs__ - These are the traditional multilayer PCBs made by laminating alternating layers of copper and a substrate material, most commonly and epoxy / glass fiber composite called FR4. The number of layers ranges from just one (a single-sided board) to over thirty (30) layers in the case of backplanes, etc. The finished thickness of rigid boards ranges typically from ~ 81Âµm (0.032") to 9.5 mm (0.375") again for backplanes where dense connectivity is required. Often they have a green color resulting from the use of a green soldermask to protect the outer copper traces from abrasion and corrosion.
