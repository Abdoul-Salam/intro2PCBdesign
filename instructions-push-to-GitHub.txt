Type in the following commands to update the public GitHub repository with whatever is on the branch you are on. 
These steps assume you've git pull'd this GitLab repo recently enough so that this GitLab repo reflects the current edition of the GitHub repo.

1. git remote add public https://github.com/lab64makerspace/intro2PCBdesign.git -- adds the link to the GitHub under the alias 'public'
2. git push public master -- pushes the GitLab 'master' branch to 'public', i.e. the intro2PCBdesign GitHub repo

Hopefully that worked
