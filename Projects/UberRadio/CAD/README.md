### Some CAD files you might find useful.

Please note : These are ROUGH things meant to help you find your way. They are NOT the definitive word on your board outlines. We can talk about this if you hav questions or concerns.

Many of these are SolidWorks files. That is the CAD program that I use. If you are using a different CAD program, e.g., OnShape, etc., you should be able to import the .step files.

If you need help send the lab64 CAs a note or you can send me a note. (The CAs are probably better at these things than I am.)
