## Board design is engineering!
I would like to get this out of the way since it really bugs me! There are two topics that I would like to address:

* what do ENGINEERS _do_, and
* the common "board spin" disease

### What do ENGINEERS DO?
Many folks have a mental image of an engineer... even engineers have some image of themselves and it usually involves somebody that is thinking hard solving some technological problem that requires a bunch of fancy equipment, maybe some sparks, and certainly a stroke of genius.

These images are certainly entertaining, but after thinking about this question, I would like to propose what I believe is a somewhat deeper answer that may be at odds with the idea of the lone genius inventor. My answer is -
### ENGINEERS make the world more PREDICTABLE!
I know, this seems a bit boring and abstract, but I think it's true. Engineers make our everyday lives better by making things predictable.

* When we cross a bridge, it doesn't fall down! Thank you civil engineers!!
* When we get on an airplane, it usually gets to the destination! Thank you aeronautical engineers!!
* When we flip a light switch, the lights usually turn on (or off)! Thank you electrical engineers!!

So when you stop to think about it, these folks spend a LOT of time making sure that our daily experiences are predictable.

And we actually rejoice in the mundane, predictable nature of our lives!

Just think of the trouble a power outage causes. It can be a serious problem when the power goes out for even a few hours. The prolonged lack of reliable power can cause "civilization" to rip apart at the seams. Our food distribution networks and health care systems depend crucially on the reliable supply of electricity. Folks get weird when their communication systems are unavailable. BUT, thanks to all the engineers (including maintenance engineering folks), we are able to maintain the veneer of civilization.

So the ENGINEER's job is to make our world more predictable, and to achieve this engineers use MODELS to make _predictions_. The better the model, the better the prediction! So engineers use models that provide quantitative results (predictions) whenever possible. This is so they can confirm that their model is applicable to the situation of interest and so they can have confidence that the model is correct.

This means that IF we are doing ENGINEERING, we should be able to PREDICT THE RESULTS OF OUR WORK.

Yup, that's right! All the way down to the "Will the holes line up?" type of predictability. Down to the "Will the signals and timing be right?" sort of predictability.

### BOARD SPIN DISEASE (BSD)
So, now it is probably clear why I think many (not all) EE's have BSD. Often I hear things like, "We'll just catch it in the next board spin." or "We're EEs; our job is to spin boards!" and so forth.

I have to be frank about this : our design tools are so good now that we can PREDICT almost all the relevant properties of electrical PC boards.

This means that if we need to "spin a board" without some change in functionality, we didn't use the tools properly and / or we just weren't THINKING!

Why am I on such a tear here?

### Because I want to help you master PCB design tools so you don't get BSD!!

Okay, thanks for sticking with me through that...
